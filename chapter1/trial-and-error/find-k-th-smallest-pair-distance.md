##### Code:

```py
def smallestDistancePair(nums, k):
    def possible(guess):
        #Is there k or more pairs with distance <= guess?
        count = left = 0
        for right, x in enumerate(nums):
            while x - nums[left] > guess:
                left += 1
            count += right - left
        return count >= k

    nums.sort()
    lo = 0
    hi = nums[-1] - nums[0]
    while lo < hi:
        mi = (lo + hi) / 2
        if possible(mi):
            hi = mi
        else:
            lo = mi + 1

    return lo
```

##### Explanation:

This problem is a little harder to understand.

We first figure out the search space, which is `[0, max(nums) - min(nums)]`. We define the K-th smallest pair distance: given an integer `dist`, let `count(dist)` denote the number of pair distances that are no greater than `dist`, then the K-th smallest pair distance will be the smallest integer such that `count(dist) >= K`. This is the verification portion.

The trial section of the code is relatively straight forward - shrink the search space until we converge on the smallest `num` which causes `countLTE(nums, num)` to return True.

Na√Øvely implemented, the verification portion would take $$\small \mathcal O(n^{2})$$ time, since we'd have to loop through all pairs and see how many them are less than num. However, doing it like so disregards the previous work we put into sorting the array. We will use a sliding window approach to count the number of pairs with distance `<=` guess. For every possible `right`, we maintain the loop invariant: `left` is the smallest value such that `nums[right] - nums[left] <= guess`. Then, the number of pairs with `right` as it's right-most endpoint is `right - left`, and we add all of these up.

 Time Complexity: $$\small O(N \log{W} + N \log{N})$$, where $$\small N$$ is the length of `nums`, and $$\small W$$ is equal to `nums[-1] - nums[0]`. The $$\small \log{W}$$ factor comes from our binary search, and we do $$\small \mathcal O(n)$$ work each inside each call for verification. The $$\small \mathcal O(N \log{N})$$ factor comes from the initial sorting of the array.
