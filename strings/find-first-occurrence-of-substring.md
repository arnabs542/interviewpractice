#### Find First Occurrence of Substring

> Given a string and a pattern, find the starting indices of all occurrences of the pattern in the string. For example, given the string "abracadabra" and the pattern "abr", you should return `[0, 7]`.

The problem prompt from above is from a DCP question asked by Microsoft. I will solve the simpler version of finding the first occurrence of the pattern as a way of introducing the Rabin-Karp and Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithms commonly used for string matching.
