#### Implement a Hash Function for Chess

> The state of a game of chess is determined by what piece is present on each square. Each square may be empty, or have one of six classes of piece; each piece may be black or white. Thus 4 bits suffice per square, which means that a total of 64 \* 4 = 256 bits can represent the state of the chessboard \(this is a simplified scenario, since we disregard turns, castling rights, etc.\). Design a hash function for chess game states. Your function should take a state and the has code for that state, and a move, and efficiently compute the has code for the update state.
