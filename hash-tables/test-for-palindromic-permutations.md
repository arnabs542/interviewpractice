Test for Palindromic Permutations

A palindrom is a string that reads the same forwards and backwards, e.g., "level", "rotator", and "foobaraboof". 

Write a program to test whether the letters forming a string can be permuted to form a plaindrome. For example, "edified" can be permuted to form "deified".
