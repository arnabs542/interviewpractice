#### Number of Strict Monotone Sequences

Call a decimal number $$\small D$$, as defined above, strictly monotone if $$\small D[i] < D[i+1], 0 \leq i < |{D}|$$. Write a program which takes as input a positive integer $$\small k$$ and computes the number of decimal numbers of length $$\small k$$ that are monotone.
