#### Find the Longest Nondecreasing Subsequence

> The problem of finding the longest nondecreasing subsequence in a sequence of integers has implications to many disciplines, including string matching and analyzing card games. As a concrete instance, the length of a longest nondecreasing subsequence for the array $$\small <0, 8, 4, 12, 2, 10, 6, 14, 1, 9>$$ is 4. Note there are multiple longest nondecreasing subsequences, e.g., $$\small <0,4,10,14>$$ and $$\small <0,2,6,9>$$. Also note that the elements of non-decreasing subsequence are not required to immediately follow each other in the original sequence.
