#### Pick Up Coins for Maximum Gain

> In the pick-up-coins game, and even number of coins are placed in a line. Two players take turns at choosing one coin each - they can only choose from the two coins at the ends of the line. The game ends when all the coins have been picked up. The player whose coins have the higher total value wins. A player cannot pass his turn.

> Design an efficient algorithm for computing the maximum total value for the starting player in the pick-up-coins game.

##### Dynamic Programming

It's important to note that a greedy approach will not work for this problem. Suppose the coins are \[5, 25, 10, 1\]. If the first player chooses 5, the second player will choose 25, and thus win. The first player needs to choose 1 in order to force the second player to expose the 25, and thus lose the game. The fundamental problem with the greedy approach is that it doesn't consider the opportunities created for the second player.

This leads to a key insight - the first player needs to balance selecting high coins with minimizing the coins available to the second player.

```js
def maximum_revenue(coins):

    dp = [[0] * len(coins) for _ in range(len(coins))]

    for length in range(len(coins)):
        for start in range(len(coins)):
            if length == 0:
                dp[start][start] = coins[start]
            elif start + length >= len(coins):
                break
            else:
                dp[start][start + length] = max(coins[start] - dp[start + 1][start + length], 
                                                coins[start + length] - dp[start][start + length - 1])

    return (sum(coins) + dp[0][-1]) // 2
```

The array `dp` keeps track of the maximum difference between the two scores depending on the index bounds. For example, the entry at `dp[i][j]` will store the maximum difference between player one's score and player two's final score if we start the game with `coins[i:j+1]`. A positive score means that at the end, player one will win by that much. A negative score means player one will lose by that much.

When we come across an entry `dp[i][j],` we can choose to take from `coins[i]` or `coins[j]`. If we take from `coins[i]`, then it's the same as player two starting from `dp[i+1][j]`, so the final difference between the scores is `coins[i] - dp[i+1][j]`. The same logic applies for picking `coins[j]` instead.
