#### Count the Number of Score Combinations

> In an American football game, a play can lead to 2 points \(safety\), 3 points \(field goal\), or 7 points \(touchdown, assuming the extra point\). Many different combinations of 2,3, and 7 point plays can make up a final score. For example, four combinations of plays yield a score of 12:
>
> * 6 safeties \(2\*6 = 12\)
> * 3 safeties and 2 field goals \(2\*3 + 3\*2 = 12\)
> * 1 safety, 1 field goal and 1 touchdown \(2\*1 + 3\*1 + 7\*1 = 12\), and 
> * 4 field goals \(3\*4 = 12\)
>
> Write a program that takes the final score and scores for individual plays, and returns of the number of combinations of plays that result in the final score.
