#### Test if Three BST Nodes are Totally Ordered

> Write a program which takes two nodes in a BST and a third node, the "middle" node, and determines if one of the two nodes is a proper ancestor and the other a proper descendant of the middle. \(A proper ancestor of a node is an ancestor that is not equal to the node; a proper descendant is defined similarly\). Assume all keys are unique. Nodes do not have pointers to their parents.
